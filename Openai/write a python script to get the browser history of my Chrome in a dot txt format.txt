OpenAi response for Prompt : just Nova I need your assistance for one job that is using artificial intelligence write a python script to get the browser history of my Chrome in a dot txt format 
************************

Certainly! To help you write a Python script that extracts your Chrome browser history and saves it in a .txt file, I recommend using the `sqlite3` module to access Chrome's history database. The following script should achieve this:

```python
import sqlite3

def get_chrome_history():
    # Path to your Chrome history database
    history_db = '/home/USERNAME/.config/google-chrome/Default/History'  # Replace USERNAME with your system username

    # Connect to the Chrome history database
    connection = sqlite3.connect(history_db)
    cursor = connection.cursor()

    # Query to fetch the browser history
    query = "SELECT title, url, last_visit_time FROM urls ORDER BY last_visit_time DESC"

    # Execute the query
    cursor.execute(query)

    # Fetch all the rows from the query result
    history = cursor.fetchall()

    # Close the database connection
    connection.close()

    return history

def save_history_to_txt(history):
    with open('chrome_history.txt', 'w') as file:
        # Loop through the history and write it to the file
        for entry in history:
            title = entry[0]
            url = entry[1]
            last_visit_time = entry[2]
